# Handwritten_Number_Recognition
This project aims at recognizing digits from handwritten images. It utilizes the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of handwritten digits that is commonly employed as a benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision. MNIST has been a cornerstone in the development and evaluation of machine learning models, particularly in the early stages of deep learning. 

This is a demonstration  of using a simple neural network. It uses a neural network consisting of a Flatten layer and 2 Dense layers. It includes a callback function which can be used to prevent the model from overfitting.
